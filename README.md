## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
  - I learnt how to add comments to my code and it made my code very clean


```html
 <h1><span>SEDANS</span></h1>
 i think i now understand the use of span property in HTML now better
```
```css

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

I always saw this code in almost every code i read, through  Stackoverflow i was able to understand the use. It resets all the margins and paddings of our site. And also that '*' means universal selector.


  @media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
    .main-box {
      display: flex;
      width: 960px;
    }
    - Yeah also on this project i started with mobile view first then updated the media queries to laptop view after, have never done anything close like that before

```

### Continued development

 I still think i am weak on CSS flexbox, border box and hue. I need to work more on them
